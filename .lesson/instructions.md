Design a CruiseShip class that extends the Ship class. The CruiseShip class should have the following members:

A field for the maximum number of passengers (an int).
A constructor and appropriate accessors and mutators.
A toString method that overrides the toString method in the base class. The CruiseShip class’s ToString method should display only the ship’s name and the maximum number of passengers.


Design a CargoShip class that extends the Ship class. The CargoShip class should have the following members:

A field for the cargo capacity in tonnage (an int).
A constructor and appropriate accessors and mutators.
A ToString method that overrides the ToString method in the base class. The CargoShip class’s ToString method should display only the ship’s name and the ship’s cargo capacity.

Make sure you call the superclass constructor in the subclass constructors.
